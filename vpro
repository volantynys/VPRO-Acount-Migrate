# Modified by Rich Trouton
#
# Version 1.2 - Added the ability to check if the OS is running on Mac OS X 10.7, and run "killall opendirectoryd"
# instead of "killall DirectoryService" if it is.
#
# Version 1.3 - Added the ability to check if the OS is running on Mac OS X 10.7 or higher (including 10.8)
# and run "killall opendirectoryd"  instead of "killall DirectoryService" if it is.
#
# Version 1.4 - Changed the admin rights function from using dscl append to using dseditgroup
#
# Version 1.5 - Fixed the admin rights functionality so that it actually now grants admin rights
